      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this project we made a comparative study between clustering analysis,
which is typically used in mobility scenarios, and supervised classification for the identification of home and work zones of an area. We will use
a mobility dataset from the city of Milan to achieve this. Using passive
mobile positioning data offers a powerful tool to study the geography
and the mobility of the population. With the available data, we will try to
identify workplaces and residential areas using both supervised classification and clustering. In order to generate training data for the classification
model, we manually label several sub-regions of the available grid, one
with random cells and another with a 20-by-20 resolution. Experimental
results show that the kNN algorithm provides an acceptable accuracy
that could be able to predict if a cell represent a working or a residential
area for the full grid, thanks to the semi-supervised approach used in
learning from a manually-labeled region. However, the results provided
with k-means and k-medoids clustering show that it is not able to accomplish the former idea, instead it focuses on identifying the mobile traffic
distribution around the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experiment and its results are available in the Github repository linked.
We have created a 20x20 and a random sub-grid in order to make the experiments, which consisted of performing a kNN classification of home-work label and later on a prediction of this label for the whole region using training data from the previously defined sub-grids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we analysed several clustering algorithms in order to determine if they would be able to detect home and work areas. We used k-means and k-medoids clustering and found out that the results did not provide insight about the home or working zones, instead the clustering focused on detecting the areas with more to least mobile traffic in Milan.&lt;/p&gt;
